## Admin System

This bot features a **Dynamic Admin Recognition System** that allows flexible admin management without code changes.

### Environment Variables

Configure admins using these environment variables:

#### `ADMIN_IDS`
Comma-separated list of Telegram user IDs:
```bash
ADMIN_IDS="6649936329,123456789,987654321"
```

#### `ADMIN_USERNAMES` 
Comma-separated list of Telegram usernames (without @):
```bash
ADMIN_USERNAMES="rayben445,admin2,moderator3"
```
*Note: Users must interact with the bot at least once for username resolution*

#### `GITHUB_ADMIN_MAPPING`
JSON mapping GitHub usernames to Telegram IDs:
```bash
GITHUB_ADMIN_MAPPING='{"RayBen445":"6649936329","contributor2":"123456789"}'
```

### Automatic Features

- **Repository Owner Recognition**: RayBen445 (repository owner) is automatically recognized as admin when properly mapped
